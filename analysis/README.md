# Analysis Scripts

After running a set of tests, the scripts in this folder can be used to generate the graphs used in the paper. They will automatically search the tests/out folder, so there is no need to move generated log files. Simply run each Python script and it will generate one or more graphs.

The provided accuracy.json file has been created using test data from EleutherAI's [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) and is not generated by this utility. If you would like to run the accuracy tests as well, we recommend using this additional utility.
